  Brain Gains is a flashcard app that uses the basic methods of the
  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leitner_system">Leitner System</a>. You can use it to write flash cards in
  question and answer form. Then quiz yourself on the topic. By practicing recall with spaced repetition, we ensure we
  retain the information better.
</p>

<p class="text-start">
  The Leitner system is a method to schedule how often you might test recalling the answer to a flash card question.

<h2 class="m-3"><strong>BrainGains</strong> helps keep all of this simple and organized for you.</h2><br />

<h3 class="text-start mt-3 mb-3"><strong>Instructions</strong></h3><br />
<p class="text-start indent">
    <strong>1. Take a Course</strong><br />
    <strong>2. Write Flashcards as Notes</strong><br />
    <strong>3. Quiz Daily</strong><br />
    <strong>4. Repeat until you're not offered any questions.</strong><br />
</p>

<h3 class="text-start mt-3 mb-3"><strong>How it Works</strong></h3><br />
<p class="text-start indent">
  <strong>Session 1:</strong><br />
  To start, all questions are in Box 1.<br />
  Quiz on those questions, Correct questions move up one box, incorrect questions go back to Box 1.<br />
  You will rate how you did on the question, choosing correct or incorrect.
</p>

<p class="text-start indent">
  <strong>Session 2:</strong><br />
  The next day you would quiz, using Box 1 and Box 2 questions.<br />
  Correct questions move up one box, incorrect questions go back to Box 1.
</p>

<p class="text-start indent">
  <strong>Session 3:</strong><br />
  Day 3, quiz Box 1, Box 2, and Box 3 together.<br />
  Correct questions move up one box, incorrect questions go back to Box 1.
</p>

<p class="text-start indent">Leitner suggests the following spacing:</p>
<ul class="text-start">
  <li>Box 1: Review daily.</li>
  <li>Box 2: Review every 2 days.</li>
  <li>Box 3: Review every 4 days.</li>
  <li>Box 4: Review every 8 days.</li>
  <li>Box 5: Review every 16 days.</li>
</ul>

<p>This process repeats over time until you've graduated the question, it moves into Box 6, and you will no longer be asked it.<br/>
